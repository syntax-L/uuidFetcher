# uuidFetchur
a super bare-bones uuid fetchur

# How to use?
The official website where I host this app is https://uuidfetcher.pages.dev/
if, for any reason, the site is down or the rate limit is exhausted, you can do the following to obtain someone's uuid

1. Open a new tab on your browser
2. visit the url "https://playerdb.co/api/player/minecraft/your_username_here"  (add the username at the end of the url) (the uuid is the string after "id: ")
3. you can try mojang's api too but it keeps blocking my requests and I use PlayerDB for this website.
    mojang api url = "https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/your_username_here"  (add the username at the end of the url) (the uuid is the string after "id: ")
